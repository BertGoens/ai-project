# Installation
1.Download the msi installer from [download page](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) or download the previous version if the latest version doesn't work. We had to use the [elasticsearch 5.6.5 version](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-5-6-5).
2.You can leave all the settings as default.
	We had to run the configuration with 1.8GB memory because we hadn't enough memory.
3.For plugins you can select X-pack. X-pack has a lot of features that can help the monitoring of a system.
	You can find more information on the [X-pack page](https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack).
	X-pack is recommended to use because there's machine learning in the package what could help a lot with the project.
4.After the selections of the plugins you can install elasticsearch.
5.When the installation is completed you can exit the installation wizard.
